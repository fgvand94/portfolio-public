	 		<p>Insert a basic description of what this website is about here. I'm not exactly sure yet. I just thought a forum would be good practice and the idea of conservation/new energy ideas seemed relevant although I don't know if creating a forum based solely on ideas for new sustainable technologies and living ideas is that practical. I've extended this to general nature discussions in the community page although I've just barely built the HTML for that.</p>
